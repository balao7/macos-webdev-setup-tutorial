Better to install node with nvm instead of homebrew. Allows us the flexibility to easily update node, have multiple version as well.

## Install nvm

Allow you to manage your node version

- https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.2/install.sh | bash
```

restart terminal

### check version

```sh
nvm --version
```

### Debug

if you're comand nvm isn't recognized try adding the code to your shell profile

we're using zsh so you would add it to.

```
nano ~/.zshrc
```

```sh
#.zshrc
export NVM_DIR="$([ -z "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}" ] && printf %s "${HOME}/.nvm" || printf %s "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm")"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
# This loads nvm
```

### other shell profiles

- ~/.bash_profile
- ~/.profile
- ~/.bashrc

## Install Node

```sh
nvm install node
```

```sh
nvm use node
```

## Check Node and NPM Version

```sh
node -v && npm -v
```

## Update nvm

```sh
nvm install node --reinstall-packages-from=node
```

#check version
node -v && npm -v
```
